# agile-rates

An experiment with [jq.py](https://github.com/mwilliamson/jq.py), [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) and [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) to get Octopus Energy's Agile electricity prices.

On [Agile Octopus](https://octopus.energy/agile/) electricity prices change every half hour.
Every day around 5 pm, Octopus publish the prices for the following day.
This scrapes those prices and stores them in a SQLite database, which you can [query using Datasette](https://agile.tomwphillips.co.uk/).
Datasette provides a quick and easy API, which [Observable queries to generate plots](https://observablehq.com/@tomwphillips/octopus-agile-rates).

Agile is interesting for lots of reasons. But simply I think most people can save money by switching and making minor changes to their habits.
